Revision and Build logic.


The three BloonProject has got a revision and build logic, represented by 5 numbers like this :

Revision BETA 1 Build 00000


- Add 5 points when you fix a lot of low issue, security issue... and another.
- Add 10 points when you fix a lot of medium risk issue... and another.
- Add 25 points when you fix a lot of critical issue... and another
- Add 50 points when you fix a lot of high security risk issue... and another
- Add 100 points when you have edited any files to make it better, plus fix any issue.
- When the 4th and 5th build number change, change the Revision number for this 4th and 5th number exemple :

BETA (12) Build (12)500

This logic can be edited by staff.
